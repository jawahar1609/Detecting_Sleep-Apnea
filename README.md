# Detecting_Sleep-Apnea
Sleep apnea is a dangerous sleeping problem in which breathing regularly begins and stops while sleeping. If left untreated, this illness might result in major health problems. The goal of this project is to develop a reliable method for detecting sleep apnea and automatically tracking the region of interest. To find noise-free edges of the body, the approach comprises converting the collected video into grayscale pictures, followed by Gaussian blur and Canny edge detection. In addition, to precisely identify body motions, the current frame is compared to the prior frame. This project also includes a new method for changing the region of interest inside the frame automatically. The effectiveness and accuracy of the suggested approach in detecting sleep apnea are demonstrated in a variety of testing situations.
